## Developer Tools

### Pre-commit Hooks
Pre-commit hooks ensure that code complies with required linting and formatting guidelines. These hooks run automatically before commits but can also be executed manually. To bypass checks during a commit, use the `--no-verify` flag.

To install and use pre-commit hooks:
```bash
# Install required dependencies
poetry install --sync --with linting,tests,docs
# Initialize pre-commit hooks for the repository
poetry run pre-commit install
# Run pre-commit checks on all files
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
