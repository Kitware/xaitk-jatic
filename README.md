### Developer Tools

Ensure the source tree is acquired locally before proceeding.

#### Poetry Install

You can install using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

> [!IMPORTANT] XAITK-JATIC currently requires `poetry<2.0`

> [!WARNING] Users unfamiliar with Poetry should use caution. See
> [installation documentation](https://xaitk-jatic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#from-source)
> for more information.

```bash
poetry install --with main,linting,tests,docs --extras "<extra1> <extra2> ..."
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks ensure that code complies with required linting and formatting
guidelines. These hooks run automatically before commits but can also be
executed manually. To bypass checks during a commit, use the `--no-verify` flag.

To install and use pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
poetry install --sync --with main,linting,tests,docs
# Initialize pre-commit hooks for the repository
poetry run pre-commit install
# Run pre-commit checks on all files
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
