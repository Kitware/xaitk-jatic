## Documentation
Documentation snapshots for releases as well as the latest master are hosted
on [ReadTheDocs](https://xaitk-jatic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The sphinx-based documentation may also be built locally for the most
up-to-date reference:
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install --sync --with dev-linting,dev-testing,dev-docs
# Navigate to the documentation root.
cd docs
# Build the docs.
poetry run make html
# Open in your favorite browser!
firefox _build/html/index.html
```

## Developer tools

**pre-commit hooks**
pre-commit hooks are used to ensure that any code meets all linting and
formatting guidelines required. After installing, this will always run before
 committing to ensure that any commits are following the standards, but you
 can also manually run the check without committing. If you want to commit
 despite there being errors, you can add `--no-verify` to your commit command.

Installing pre-commit hooks:
```bash
# Ensure that all dependencies are installed
poetry install --sync --with dev-linting,dev-testing,dev-docs
# Initialize pre-commit for the repository
poetry run pre-commit install
# Run pre-commit check on all files
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
