Pending Release Notes
=====================
This is the initial release of this repository which hosts integration
documentation, examples and code related to integrating xaitk-saliency
components with the CDAO needs and use-cases.

This first release defines an xaitk-cdao package that is currently a
placeholder for future functionality, as well as an initial example jupyter
notebook that explains how to integrate HuggingFace datasets and models with
the xaitk-saliency API to generate saliency maps.
